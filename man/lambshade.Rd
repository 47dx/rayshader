\usage{
lambshade(heightmap, rayangle, sunangle, zscale = 1, zero_negative = TRUE,
  remove_edges = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{heightmap}{A two-dimensional matrix, where each entry in the matrix is the elevation at that point. All points are assumed to be evenly spaced.}

\item{rayangle}{The angle as measured from the horizon from which the light originates.}

\item{sunangle}{The angle around the matrix from which the light originates.}

\item{zscale}{Default 1. The ratio between the x and y spacing (which are assumed to be equal) and the z axis.}

\item{zero_negative}{Default TRUE. Zeros out all values below 0 (corresponding to surfaces facing away from the light source).}

\item{remove_edges}{Default TRUE. Slices off artifacts on the edge of the shadow matrix.}
}
\value{
Matrix of light intensities at each point.
}
\description{
Calculates local shadow map for a elevation matrix by calculating the dot 
product between light direction and the surface normal vector at that point. Each point's
intensity is proportional to the cosine of the normal ve

\examples{
#Here we produce a light intensity map of the `volcano` elevation map.
volcanointensity = lambshade(heightmap = volcano, 
   rayangle = 55, 
   sunangle = 45, 
   zscale = 1)
