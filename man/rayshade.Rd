\usage{
rayshade(heightmap, anglebreaks, sunangle, maxsearch, lambert = TRUE,
  zscale = 1, multicore = FALSE, remove_edges = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{heightmap}{A two-dimensional matrix, where each entry in the matrix is the elevation at that point. All points are assumed to be evenly spaced.}

\item{anglebreaks}{The angle(s), in degrees, as measured from the horizon from which the light originates.}

\item{sunangle}{The angle, in degrees, around the matrix from which the light originates. Zero degrees is due North.}

\item{maxsearch}{The maximum distance that the system should propogate rays to check. For longer}

\item{lambert}{Default TRUE. Changes the intensity of the light at each point based proportional to the
dot product of the ray direction and the surface normal at that point. Zeros out all values directed away from
the ray.}

\item{zscale}{Default 1. The ratio between the x and y spacing (which are assumed to be equal) and the z axis.}

\item{multicore}{Default FALSE. If TRUE, multiple cores will be used to compute the shadow matrix. By default, this uses all cores available, unless the user has
set `options("cores")` in which the multicore option will only use that many cores.}

\item{remove_edges}{Default TRUE. Slices off artifacts on the edge of the shadow matrix.}
}
\value{
Matrix of light intensities at each point.
}
\description{
Calculates global shadow map for a elevation matrix by propogating rays from each matrix point to the light source(s),
lowering the brightness at each point for each ray that intersects the surface.
}
\examples{
#Here we produce an shadow map of the `volcano` elevation map with the light from the NE.
volcanoshadow = rayshade(heightmap = volcano, 
   anglebreaks = seq(55,65,10), 
   sunangle = 315, 
   maxsearch = 100)
   
\dontrun{volcanoshadow_fast = rayshade(heightmap = volcano, 
   anglebreaks = seq(0,90,10), 
   sunangle = 45, 
   maxsearch = 100,
   multicore=TRUE)}
   
#Turn off Lambertian shading to get a shadow map solely based on the raytraced shadows.
volcanoshadow = rayshade(heightmap = volcano, 
   anglebreaks = seq(30,40,10), 
   sunangle = 45, 
   maxsearch = 100,
   lambert = FALSE)
