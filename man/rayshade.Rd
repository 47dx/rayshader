\usage{
rayshade(heightmap, anglebreaks, sunangle, maxsearch, zscale = 1,
  multicore = FALSE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{heightmap}{A two-dimensional matrix, where each entry in the matrix is the elevation at that point. All points are assumed to be evenly spaced.}

\item{anglebreaks}{The angle(s) as measured from the horizon from which the light originates.}

\item{sunangle}{The angle around the matrix from which the light originates.}

\item{maxsearch}{The maximum distance that the system should propogate rays to check. For longer}

\item{zscale}{Default 1. The ratio between the x and y spacing (which are assumed to be equal) and the z axis.}

\item{multicore}{Default FALSE. If TRUE, multiple cores will be used to compute the shadow matrix. By default, this uses all cores available, unless the user has
set `options("cores")` in which the multicore option will only use that many cores.}

\item{verbose}{Default TRUE. Tracks progress by outputing the current column being shaded to the console.}
}
\value{
Matrix of light intensities at each point.
}
\description{
Calculates global shadow map for a elevation matrix by propogating rays from each matrix point to the light source(s),
lowering the brightness at each point for each ray that intersects the surface.
}
\examples{
#Here we produce an shadow map of the `volcano` elevation map.
volcanoshadow = rayshade(heightmap = volcano, 
   anglebreaks = seq(-90,90,10)*pi/180, 
   sunangle = 45*pi/180, 
   maxsearch = 100,
   zscale = 1)
   
\dontrun{volcanoshadow_fast = rayshade(heightmap = volcano, 
   anglebreaks = seq(-90,90,10)*pi/180, 
   sunangle = 45*pi/180, 
   maxsearch = 100,
   zscale = 1, 
   multicore=TRUE)}
