\title{Detect water}
\usage{
detect_water(heightmap, cutoff = 0.999, min_area = length(heightmap)/400,
  normalvectors = NULL, remove_edges = TRUE, keep_groups = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{heightmap}{A two-dimensional matrix, where each entry in the matrix is the elevation at that point. All grid points are assumed to be evenly spaced.}

\item{cutoff}{Default `0.999`. The lower limit of the z-component of the unit normal vector to be classified as water.}

\item{min_area}{Default length(heightmap)/400. Minimum area (in units of the height matrix x and y spacing) to be considered a body of water.}

\item{normalvectors}{Default `NULL`. Pre-computed array of normal vectors from the `calculate_normal` function. Supplying this will speed up water detection.}

\item{remove_edges}{Default `TRUE`. Slices off artifacts on the edge of the shadow matrix.}

\item{keep_groups}{Default `FALSE`. If `TRUE`, the matrix returned will retain the numbered grouping information.}
}
\value{
Matrix indicating whether water was detected at that point. 1 indicates water, 0 indicates no water.
}
\description{
Detects bodies of water (of a user-defined minimum size) within an elevation matrix.

\examples{
library(magrittr)
#Here we even out a portion of the volcano dataset to simulate water:
island_volcano = volcano
island_volcano[island_volcano < mean(island_volcano)] = mean(island_volcano)

#Setting a minimum area avoids classifying small flat areas as water:
island_volcano \%>\%
 sphere_shade(texture="imhof3") \%>\%
 add_water(detect_water(island_volcano, min_area = 400),color="imhof3") \%>\%
 plot_map()
